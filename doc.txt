The code provided is part of a console-based Car Rental application in Python. The application's primary goal is to allow users to view a list of cars, log in as customers, and manage car rentals. Below is a detailed explanation of the approach and logic used to structure and implement the code.

Structure and Components
Imports and Dependencies:

The code begins by importing necessary Python modules and custom classes. Modules like os, getpass, pandas, tabulate, and time are used for system operations, secure password input, data manipulation, table formatting, and time delays, respectively.
Custom classes Utility and Customer are imported to handle utility functions and customer-related operations.
CarRentalMain Class:

This class is responsible for initializing the application, reading car data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, and handling customer login.
The __init__ method reads the car data and stores it in an instance variable.
The cust_login method prompts the user for username and password (using getpass for security) and then calls the customer menu method from the Customer class.
Utility Functions:

The Utility class, contains static methods for displaying menus and handling the application's exit procedure. These methods are used throughout the application to interact with the user.
It consists all the method that are being used repeatedly.


Customer Class:

This class likely contains methods for customer-specific actions, such as viewing available cars and managing rentals. The cust_menu method is mentioned, which suggests a menu-driven interface for customer interactions.
Main Function:

The main function serves as the entry point of the application. It performs several key tasks:
Clears the screen for a clean start.
Initializes the CarRentalMain object to set up the application.
Calls utility methods to prepare and display the list of cars.
Implements a loop to display a main menu, handle user input, and execute corresponding actions based on the user's selection.
Flow Control:

The application uses a while loop to continuously display the main menu and prompt the user for their selection.
Based on the user's input, the application either displays the list of cars, handles customer login, or exits.
The use of tabulate for displaying cars in a table format enhances readability.
Visual Elements:

The print_logo function, defined within main, displays a car rental logo and a car ASCII art. This function is called with a loop to create a simple animation effect, adding a visual appeal to the application startup.
Execution Flow:

Upon running, the application clears the screen, displays the animated logo, and then welcomes the user to the Car Rental Platform CLI.
The user is then presented with a menu to choose from viewing cars, logging in, or exiting.
The application dynamically responds to user input, leading to different functionalities like showing available cars or customer login.
Conclusion
The code demonstrates a structured approach to building a console-based application in Python, utilizing object-oriented programming principles, system operations for user interaction, and data manipulation with pandas for handling car information. The application's flow is controlled through a menu-driven interface, making it user-friendly and interactive.
